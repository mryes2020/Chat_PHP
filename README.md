# Installation
The project is made with php and mysql mostly, this is why you must have a local server, and a mysql server setup (with the database, and tables) 
( For localhost hosting and mysql server i use xampp, which serves a http server + mysql server on 127.0.0.1 ) 

## Step 1
 - Clone the website and move it to the htdocs folder in xampp
## Step 2
 - Start the http server 
 - Start the mysql database server
## Step 3 
 - Make a database called: `chat_server1`
## Step 4
 - Make some tables (`chat, chathack, chatnetw, chatpro, chattalkadmins, chattehc` - each table will have 2 rows which will be `Name` and `Text`)
  - Warning! Tables, database and the rows should be named the exact way its typed!!
# Step 5
 - You're done ( now you can navigate to the url `http://localhost:80/` )
 - Warning! If you have moved a directory to the htdocs folder the url is then `http://localhost:80/[name of the directory]`!!
